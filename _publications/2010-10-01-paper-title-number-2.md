How knotted proteins fold has remained controversial since the identification of deeply knotted proteins nearly two decades ago. Both computational and experimental approaches have been used to investigate protein knot formation. Motivated by the computer simulations of B\"olinger et al. [B\"olinger D, et al. (2010) PLoS Comput Biol 6:e1000731] for the folding of the 6_1-knotted \alpha- haloacid dehalogenase (DehI) protein, we introduce a topological description of knot folding that could describe pathways for the formation of all currently known protein knot types and predicts knot types that might be identified in the future. We analyze fingerprint data from crystal structures of protein knots as evidence that particular protein knots may fold according to specific pathways from our theory. Our results confirm Taylorâ€™s twisted hairpin theory of knot folding for the 3_1-knotted proteins and the 4_1-knotted ketol-acid reductoisomerases and present alternative folding mechanisms for the 4_1-knotted phytochromes and the 5_2- and 6_1-knotted proteins.
